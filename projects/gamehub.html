                GameHub is an online shop where users can purchase and sell computer games. It was part of a cross-course school project.
                I designed the website and wrote the HTML & CSS for the first couse. In the second course,
                I added some JavaScript (contact-form validation and checkout-system). And in the third course we used WordPress as
                a headless CMS to integrate product management.
            </p>
            <div class="project__issues">
                <h2 class="project__subtitle">Issues with the project:</h2>
                <ol class="project__ol">
                    <li>
                        The biggest feedback I got after designing and implementing the validation for the contact form was that it could be
                        confusing. The confusing part being a lack of requirements for the fields and the submit button being un-clickable with no
                        message to explain why. I could also improve upon the error handling.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When going back and testing out the responsiveness I noticed I could approve upon that as well. Specifically when the user
                        only adds one product to the cart. The card would span the entire width and stretch the image. This had to be fixed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The cart system wasn't fully functional with the new CMS system on all pages, which is something I needed to fix.
                        The reason that it didn't properly work was honestly because the code was a bit of a mess after going through a few
                        iterations. To fix this I could just re-create the whole system now that I have a better perspective on everything that is
                        needed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Arguably one of the most important things on an e-commerce site is the search system. It's one of the ways a user
                        will find what they are looking for. This is less of an issue to be fixed, and more of an improvement to the site. In the same
                        vein I could also implement a functioning category system now that it's hooked up to a CMS.
                    </li>
                </ol>                
            </div>
            <div class="project__changes">
                <h2 class="project__subtitle">Changes made:</h2>
                <ol class="project__ol">
                    <li>
                        I updated the contact form to make it less confusing. The colors of inputs are now more clear, the error
                        messages doesn't show up immediately after typing and most importantly, the button is clickable. If it's
                        clicked before the fields are valid, their respective error messages will show up.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I fixed the responsiveness issue by just making sure there was a set <span class="code">grid-template-columns</span>
                        for the wrapper that contains the product cards. Then by using media-queries I changed it accordingly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since I have a lot more work to do, I just patched up the bug that made the cart system not work. I do want
                        to re-do it sometime, and will if I have time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For now, I've implemented a search system which was pretty simple seeing as the WordPress API includes an endpoint
                        just for that. I do want to implement categories as well, but I'd have to re-organize a lot to make it happen.
                    </li>
