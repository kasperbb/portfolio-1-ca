                This project was created for for the Semester Project. At this point in the semester we hadn't started
                learning JavaScript. So this project is mostly just HTML & CSS. Although I did add some small JS features like image modals
                and a scroll-to-top function.
            </p>
            <div class="project__issues">
                <h2 class="project__subtitle">Issues with the project:</h2>
                <ol class="project__ol">
                    <li>
                        One feedback I got when delivering this project was that I was missing some alt-text on the logo for some pages.
                        I had also forgot to compress some images, which left them with a large size.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Since the target audience for this website is, among others, children - some more color being implemented in the design
                        would go along way. Most of the website consists of one color, a blue-ish color.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        An improvement to the website I could make is create a functioning ticket-buying system. For now, it's just pre-made
                        HTML pages that doesn't function.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Another improvement could also be to add validation to the contact-form.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="project__changes">
                <h2 class="project__subtitle">Changes made:</h2>
                <ol class="project__ol">
                    <li>
                        Since I had forgot to update the alt-text and swap the large images for the compressed ones - this one was pretty simple
                        to fix. I just went through every HTML file and found images that didn't have alt-text and updated them. I also compressed all images
                        over a certain size.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I decided to add another color to the website, one that compliments blue very well. Specifically I chose this color
                        <span class="code red">#913a12</span>. I didn't want to go too overboard, so I used it sparingly. Mostly on some buttons
                        and part of some headings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This is probably the biggest improvement I made. I added a cart and checkout-system for buying tickets. I also made
                        sure to validate the form for buying tickets. When you buy a ticket, a modal will open up displaying the cart - 
                        and I used <span class="code">localStorage</span> to handle the cart-content.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I also implemented validation for the contact-form. This went relatively quickly as I had just implemented the same for GameHub.
                        Most of the code used for the validation is code I can share between the websites with little modification.
                    </li>
                </ol>
