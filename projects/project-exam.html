            <p class="project__description">
                My project exam for year 1 at Noroff. We were tasked with creating a blog-page. I chose to create a space-themed
                blog-page. This page uses WordPress as a headless CMS for all the content. I had to implement these pages:
                home, about, list of blog posts, blog post specific page and a contact page.
            </p>
            <div class="project__issues">
                <h2 class="project__subtitle">Issues with the project:</h2>
                <ol class="project__ol">
                    <li>
                        The number one critisism I had for myself after finishing the project was the design. Even though
                        it hit all the marks I set for myself. It was simple enough, as to not distract from the content.
                        It was vibrant enough as to not bore you. It was clearly legible and easy to navigate. Somehow, it just
                        looks kind of boring, but to improve upon this, I think I'd have to re-create most - if not all of the
                        design.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I managed to finish both the level 1 and level 2 processes for the exam. Despite this there are some
                        things I could think of to improve the blog. One that comes to mind is instead of having a "load more"
                        button - blogs could automatically load when the user scrolls to be bottom of the page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Another improvement could be to add categories to the blog posts and add some way to filter the posts by one
                        or more categories.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="project__changes">
                <h2 class="project__subtitle">Changes made:</h2>
                <ol class="project__ol">
                    <li>
                        Since I had forgot to update the alt-text and swap the large images for the compressed ones -
                        this one was pretty simple
                        to fix. I just went through every HTML file and found images that didn't have alt-text and
                        updated them. I also compressed all images
                        over a certain size.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I decided to add another color to the website, one that compliments blue very well. Specifically
                        I chose this color
                        <span class="code red">#913a12</span>. I didn't want to go too overboard, so I used it
                        sparingly. Mostly on some buttons
                        and part of some headings.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This is probably the biggest improvement I made. I added a cart and checkout-system for buying
                        tickets. I also made
                        sure to validate the form for buying tickets. When you buy a ticket, a modal will open up
                        displaying the cart -
                        and I used <span class="code">localStorage</span> to handle the cart-content.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I also implemented validation for the contact-form. This went relatively quickly as I had just
                        implemented the same for GameHub.
                        Most of the code used for the validation is code I can share between the websites with little
                        modification.
                    </li>
